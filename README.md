This project aims to predict NBA player performance using the NBA draft combine
measurements dataset from Draft Express. By analyzing physical attributes such as height,
weight, vertical jump, and agility, the study seeks to develop accurate predictive models for
player success. It addresses key questions regarding correlations between measurements
and overall performance, position-specific attributes, and the predictability of draft position
and career longevity. Through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine
learning techniques, the project provides insights to inform NBA teams&#39; draft decisions. The
results contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between physical
attributes and professional basketball performance, facilitating more effective player
selection and team
